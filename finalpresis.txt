= Intro
* (canon eos pic or something)
* Interest in realistic content in computer graphics
* Computer graphics synthesizes images from geometric data
* Computer vision analyzes geometry from images
* This work: Scanning real life objects using several digital cameras at once

= Contents
* (Roughly as in the thesis, add TOC here)

= Motivation
* (ira pic)
* The processing power of GPUs big and increases
* Able to process massive level of detail
* Creating content manually tedious, difficult to get right
* => Scan the geometry and color using digital cameras

(some below OR condense all to a single slide: principles, reality)

= Pinhole camera
* Some imaging background first
* (modified wikipedia pic)
* Projects a 3D scene perfectly on a film

= Actual camera
* (simplified dslr box?)
* Lens systems, geometric distortion, color distortion, depth of field, image resolution, frame rate, image quality, ...

= Imaging
* (or box here? or sth larger? or combine the previous slide here?)
* light travels from subject to sensor, to digital file
* Assumed uniform lighting, still non-shiny subject
* Video = consecutive image frames

= Video
* (ruler pic?)
* Moving subject?
* Non-flickering lighting
* Motion blur
* Rolling shutter
* Synchronization

= 2D to 3D
* Camera projection, calibration
* Reconstruct 3D geometry <=> apply projection in inverse
* Determine scene from multiple viewpoints

= Principle: depth from disparity
* (both theory pics? depth and epipolargeom)
* Simple triangulation, in principle
* Two views, two image positions => 3D position with depth
* In practice, many more sophisticated dense algos
* Complete pipeline needs to consider everything

= Reconstruction system
* (pic: MV cam, DSLR, pocket cam)
* Using the background theory, construct a reconstruction rig
* Requirements to be flexible and general purpose, easy to use
* Human head as a special interest
* Heavy study on available hardware and software solutions

= Rig implementation
* (photo of cams from the front)
* nine Canon EOS DSLR cameras with 50 mm lenses
* remote trigger tool
* auxiliary HW, support SW
* Not restricted to any specific reconstruction SW

= Remote trigger tool
* (photo of the box open)
* Simultaneous or arbitrary focus and shutter release
* Custom built on a microcontroller using wired remote connectors
* Commercial tools mostly wireless and expensive

= Software
* Just camera controls, based on *gphoto2*
* Generic open source library for cameras
* Preview tool, image download, camera configuration, remote shutter
* 3D reconstruction development out of scope

= Previewer
* (pic)
* A great aid in aiming the rig as a whole
* Individual orientations with the viewfinders though

= Control
* Camera exposes parameters via USB
* Shutter speed, aperture, ...
* Mostly implemented in gphoto2 CLI
* Image download as soon as captured
* USB connection to remote trigger box

= Experiments
* Synch tests
* Sample scans
* Several reconstruction programs tested

= Source data

= Output geometry

= Hand

= Legos

= Issues
* Video synchronization
* Light requirements
* Post processing
* Camera quirks

= Conclusion
* Background survey, built reconstruction rig
* easy to get sub-millimeter-scale content
* Future work: actually use it
* Data needs post-processing
