first slide
- hi this is about 3d scanning

1
preintro
- cg evolves
- increasingly deeper demand for hq content
- parts of those two technologies combined

1
contents
- blah blah

2
motivation
- computer hw becoming faster and faster
- lod massive, development not going to stop
- generating content manually impossible
- static geometry is difficult enough
- and then there is computer animation
- -> just capture a subject in real life
- and reproduce that

2
imaging
- cameras are complicated.
- whole imaging process is complex
- especially to capture only surface color..
- instead of what it looks like in a naive environment
- diffuse (uniform) lighting etc
- cg, material models, imitate light reflection (pic)
- trying to produce color data for those models
- static imaging is difficult? how about video then?

4
video
- all right
- what is video anyway? frames in sequence
- assume photographed subject moving, otherwise no point
- capture N fps, integrating light fixed time
- and so we get many problems too
- motion blur: fast subject smeared as integrated
- rolling shutter: imaging sensor read slowly
- line skipping: aliasing etc: not every line used
- last but not least sync as group maybe impossible

5
simplified methods
- a camera is a projective object
- formulate properly -> divide to steps
- assume linear camera etc
- assume sth on scene
- detect distinct corners/features
- match features
- reconstruct depth for matches
- reconstruct surface

6
depth from disparity
- calculating depth not that complicated
- take two matching points, both projected linearly
- know camera baseline, poses, triangulate
- but wait, there is more
- how match in the first place?
- noise, outliers etc
- full pipeline does much more

7
stereo system
- step one. have many cameras.
- calibrate the cameras
- known geometry/autodetect matches
- system of eqs, similar projections
- depth/disparity > need poses for triangulation
- N views given -> match, triangulate, filter

8
practical reconstruction system
- now, what i built
- given knowledge, build *practical* 3d scanner
- interest in face, maybe animation
- looked in camera types, programs -> conclusions

9
rig implementation
- entry-level dslr
- controllable, cheap, hquality; cant sync video
- wired remote for still sync and shoot
- support magic lantern 3rd party fw addon
- supports, wiring
- cam ctrl utilities etc

10
remote trigger tool
- cams support wired remote
- built tool for concurrent shooting
- small cheap micro, usb conn
- commercial ones wireless, expensive, unknown
- did this for open design and testing

11
software
- sw consists of cam support, reconstruction then
- not much camera ctl libraries there
- just remote shoot, cam cfg in my work
- gphoto2, open source, image download etc

12
previewer
- graphical grid, simultaneous liveview
- individually with viewfinder

12
control
- some of params on the right
- gphoto also cli tool
- wrote small tool for concurrent fast download
- also python for remote box

13
experiments
- sync capabilities and scans
- performing full end-to-end pipeline in sw

14
source data
- 3 of 9 pics for full head scan

14
output geometry
- plain reconstructed geometry rendered
- point cloud, tex mesh
- poor quality in facial hair

15
textures
- color: different map types
- one preserves the original photographs
- othereasily modifiable image

15
hand
- this is my hand scanned
- occluded areas, not seen by all

15
legos
- missing texture is obviously not recoverable

16
rubber mask
- uniform colors bad, otherwise nice

16
level of detail
- cropped part of one photo, its reconstruction
- pore-level pixels
- note geometric detail near the eyes
- some wrinkles only in color, not geometry

16
issues
- video sync is problematic
- once started, cannot sync frames
- require no shadows, reflections
- needs manual processing to be useful
- the cameras sometimes misbehave a little

17
future work
- survey current state-art algos, high lod
- of course, use it for future study

18
conclusion
- that's it.
- my work: survey background, build 3d scanner
- quality nice and improvable from the current state
- i don't know what the future is going to offer
