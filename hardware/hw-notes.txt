hardware list:
	- 9x Canon EOS 700D
	- 9x Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lenses, no need to remove from the bodies
	- 9x Transcend 16GB memory cards, keep inside the cams
	- 9x Canon ACK-E8, power adapters because nobody wants to recharge batteries (that wire mess though...)
	- 3x D-link DUB-H4 usb hubs, remote powered but the power supplies don't seem to be needed for just the cams
	- 1x custom trigger box, connect with a mini usb
	- 9x wires for the cameras; usb to a hub, and 2,5mm stereo plug cable for the trigger
	- 4x Millenium LST-310 stand
	- 9x Manfrotto 494 ball head
	- 9x Manfrotto 035 Super Clamp, with Manfrotto 036-38 studs for attaching the ball heads to the stands
	- Lots of velcro straps

storage:
	- cases for cameras and other sensitive items
	- bags for the stands: one bag fits two
	- TODO: power cables, clamps, ballheads to stand bags or cases?

building:
	1. fix the stands where needed
	2. screw the cameras, ball heads and clamps together and to the stands
	3. connect the wires (power, usb, trigger) to the cameras; run them along the stands
	4. connect the power adapters to extension cords (can be replaced with batteries if using only for a few shots)
	5. connect the other ends of the trigger cables to the trigger box; connect a usb cable to the box
	6. use the velcro straps to fasten the dangling wires so that they stay away from the photos
	7. divide the hubs evenly for the cams, one hub per three or so; try to find different master hubs from a computer so that they would share the load well
	8. aim the cameras to the target, setup lighting and start shooting

unpacking:
	- just repeat the build steps in reverse order
