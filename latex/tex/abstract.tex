In applications of three-dimensional computer graphics, realistic content is increasingly needed.
Rendering of photorealistic models has become possible thanks to computing power, but creating the models is challenging to do by hand, as they need high level of detail in geometry, colors, and animation.
This task is replaced by recovering content from photographs that describe the modeled subject from multiple viewpoints.
In this thesis, elementary theory behind image acquisition and photograph-based reconstruction of geometry and colors is studied.
Recent research and software for content reconstruction are reviewed.
Based on the studied background, a rig is built as a grid of nine off-the-shelf digital cameras, a custom remote shutter trigger, and supporting software.
The mission of the rig is to capture quality photographs and video in a reliable and practical manner for processing in multi-view reconstruction programs.

The camera grid was configured to shoot single subjects for multi-view imagery experiments.
The images were then processed directly for geometry and color, with little or no image enhancements done after automatically taking the photos or video.
The rig was proved to work for the purpose of multi-view reconstruction by testing several subjects.
Two typical reconstruction software pipelines were described and reviewed.
The rig was found to perform well with little subject-specific tuning;
issues in the setup were analyzed and further improvements suggested based on the captured test models.
Pure image quality of the cameras was found to be excellent, and most problems arose from uneven lighting and practical issues.
The developed rig was found to produce sub-millimeter scale accuracy in geometry and texture of subjects such as human faces.
Future work was suggested for lighting, video synchronization and state-of-the-art image processing and reconstruction algorithms.
