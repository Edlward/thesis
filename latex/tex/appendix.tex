\section{Remote trigger} \label{app:remotetrigger}

The remote trigger consists of a Nucleo-F401RE microcontroller platform by ST microelectronics, and supporting hardware for connecting the cameras.
Each camera connects to the trigger via a 2,5mm stereo plug, as the cameras have a standard 2,5mm jack for remote trigger.
To secure the cameras from each other, the remote wires are connected with opto-isolators (TLP621-2).

\subsection{Circuit board layout}

{Remote trigger circuit board (PCB) layout}

The circuit board is 5 by 3.9 inches big and can use just one layer;
another layer is used as a ground plane, but the ground signals are routed along with the signals too.
The circuit is also simple enough to implement on e.g. a veroboard with some jumper wires.
Figure \ref{fig:triggerboard-brd-big} shows the board layout without a ground plane.

\subsection{Parts list}
