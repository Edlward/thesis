\section{System implementation}

\subsection{Functional specification} % {{{

The implementation was specified to be easy to use, portable, flexible and available for both 3D and 4D cases, 4D being a nice-to-have feature.
Portability and open design was also considered to be important.
By documenting the selected hardware and its structure, and writing control code in a generic way, it is hoped that the design could be reimplemented and/or refined by others too.

There is a wide variety of different consumer grade digital cameras.
Some of the main differences are dicussed below.

\subsubsection{Practicalities} % {{{

A general-purpose reconstruction rig has remarkably many practical matters to consider when comparing to the pure mathematical side.
A mobile rig should be light enough to carry and set up, but it should be rigid enough to give proper quality pictures and hold its calibrated configuration.
Distance to the photographed target should not be too short in order to not annoy human targets, but a too large setup is difficult to build and needs lots of space.
When capturing video, the frames should be synchronized among cameras as described in \ref{sec:somethingaboutvideosync}, which might not be possible with a reasonable budget.

- baseline width, focus, depth, fstop etc
- compression artifacts are nasty (edge detectors go wild etc.)

\subsection{Remote shutter synchronization} % {{{

% }}}

\subsubsection{Canon remote trigger} % {{{

The selected Canon EOS 700D has an input port for focus and shutter release, in addition to the integrated shutter button.
The camera uses a standard 2,5 mm sized stero jack for connecting external remote controllers.
Both mechanical and electronical remotes in wired and wireless format are available in the market, but no standard devices for triggering several cameras seem to exist.
Fortunately, the triggering method is widely researched among hobbyists; it is well enough documented in the internet.

The remote release jack is a three-contact connector, where one pin serves as a common ground, and connecting one pin to the ground triggers the camera's focus button, and the third pin releases the shutter when connected to the ground.
Luk from doc-diy.net [?] describes the camera's trigger circuit internals; the wires supply some current, which is why it's not a good idea to simply connect the remote wires of all cameras together.
A commonly used method among the DIY community is to use opto-isolators to control each camera individually, isolated from the shared control circuit.

An opto-isolator provides a galvanically separated switch that can be used to ``connect'' the release wire to the camera's ground such that no electrical signal path is shared between the cameras.
The switch is commonly a phototransistor that is triggered externally by the light transmitted from a LED.
Both the phototransistor and the LED are installed in a opaque plastic housing.
The opto-isolator device used in this work is shown in figure \ref{fig:opto-isolator}.

% TODO: fig:opto-isolator in physical form and in a schematic diagram next to each other

% }}}

\subsubsection{Synchronized multi-trigger implementation} % {{{

By connecting each camera to a separate opto-isolator and driving all them from a same source, all cameras can be triggered simultaneously in a safe fashion.
To fully automate the system, the trigger device should be connected to the computer that downloads the photos from the cameras.
In this work, a microcontroller prototyping platform called Nucleo-F401RE by STMicroelectronics was used.
This platform has a built-in USB port for simple communication.

A microcontroller is a tiny computer in a single, usually thumb-sized package containing processor, RAM, program memory and peripherals; all parts required to run a single user-defined application often with no general operating system.
The popular Arduino microcontroller board is a popular example of a small-sized microcontroller.

A microcontroller was chosen over e.g. a computer-controlled relay board because its flexibility and low price.
On one hand, such a device is more complicated to set up than a simple switch, but on the other hand, it can be programmed to sequence the cameras in any arbitrary order.
It can also be used to measure the shutter delay and the actual precise time when each camera takes the picture; each has small unpredictable variations.
When capturing moving targets, measuring this lag variation could be of interest.

The Nucleo-F401RE is a prototyping board designed around the STM32F401RET6 microcontroller IC.
This microcontroller ccontains a relatively powerful 32-bit ARM core, space for 512 KB of program code, 96 KB of RAM, 81 I/O pins, and lots of high-performance peripherals not needed in this circuit.

\subsection{Custom written software} % {{{

Parallelized image acquisition from a large set of cameras has not yet established such a state that general purpose software would be easily available.
Commercial solutions probably exist, but they are often strictly bound to a specific hardware, costly and inflexible.

Some custom techniques were used to preview images of all cameras simultaneously, configure the settings of each in parallel, and retrieve the captured images from them in order.

% }}}

\subsubsection{Camera control} % {{{

gphoto2 \cite{gphoto2} is a well-known free application and library for controlling digital cameras on Unix-like operating systems, supporting over a thousand cameras.
Instead of relying on each camera manufacturer separately for a software development kit, gphoto2 abstracts common operations behind the same interface.
For example, Canon \cite{canonsdk} and Nikon \cite{nikonsdk}, some of the biggest camera manufacturers, both provide SDKs for controlling their devices remotely.
To support both vendors, one would have to write code for both APIs.
API restrictions, licenses blahblah.

Most modern USB cameras use the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) \cite{ptpTODO} for setting properties and transferring pictures, which is also what gphoto2 implements.

It turns out that gphoto2's most thorough support is implemented for Canon and Nikon cameras.

% }}}

\subsubsection{Previewing and configuration} % {{{

Because of the flexible nature of the rig purposes, a simple preview live feed is almost mandatory to properly set up a new configuration.
A preview matrix of all cameras makes it easy to identify the cameras and to point them to correct direction, and to verify that their settings are the same (e.g. similar brightness in preview video).
Remote control of all cameras enables to set all settings, such as shutter speed and focus distance, jointly from the same computer instead of clicking on each camera's buttons manually.


% }}}

\subsubsection{Image acquisition} % {{{

The cameras cannot be triggered individually via USB even though it is possible, because it is too complex and undeterministic for multi-camera synchronization.
Instead, the remote release device is triggered via USB that then releases all shutters at the needed precision.

A custom gphoto2-based software is used to download pictures from the cameras. They are able to automatically notify about new files, which are then downloaded in proper locations via USB.

\subsection{3D reconstruction software survey} % {{{

 There is a wide collection of libraries, open-source tools and commercial packages for both automatic reconstruction and generic mesh editing for post-processing the data.
 % }}}

\subsubsection{Free libraries} % {{{

There exist several generic computer vision and geometry processing libraries, most common of them being probably OpenCV \cite{opencv}, Point Cloud Library (PCL) \cite{pcl} and Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) \cite{cgal}. These are written in the C or C++ languages and they have bindings to several scripting languages too.

OpenCV contains a large set of tools for 2D image processing and extends also to camera calibration and 3D reprojection.
It is probably the most commonly known and most used computer vision algorithm package.

PCL contains a set of algorithms for filtering, segmentation, registration, visualization, and more for working on data sets that consist of points that may share attributes such as colors and normals. CGAL's scope is in the same field, concentrating on a little more advanced topics.

% }}}

\subsubsection{Free programs} % {{{

While libraries can be used to write new tools, many pieces of software are readily available that implement the algorithms presented and are distributed in source code form and/or readily usable binary executables.

Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab, also included in OpenCV as a C port, is a more or less standard tool to computation of undistortion maps and intrinsic and extrinsic parameters with checkerboard images using non-linear optimization and homographies. \cite{camcalmatlab}

Bundler is a bundle adjustment and structure-from-motion system for computing camera poses and sparse point clouds. \cite{snavely2006photo}

SiftGPU, a SIFT implementation for graphics processing units. \cite{changchang2007siftgpu} It is built on Sift++ \cite{vedaldi2011sift++}; both are based on difference of gaussians, a method for edge detection \cite{marr1980theory}

Multicore (parallel) bundle adjustment: PBA computes the bundle step in a way that exploits the modern parallel nature of computer processors that have several computing cores. \cite{wu2011multicore}

Patch-based, clustering multi-view stereopsis (PMVS/CMVS) starts from a set of matching keypoints (features) and expands them to a dense patch set iteratively. \cite{furukawa2010accurate,furukawa2012patch}

VisualSFM \cite{wu2013towards} is a common and free but closed-source integration tool simplifying the workflow using external programs.

Meshlab \cite{meshlab} is a portable editor of point clouds and meshes.
It can be used interactively and scripted to do the same steps automatically.
In a reconstruction pipeline, it is one of the last processing steps, used for removing outliers or fitting a surface on a point cloud with the poisson surface reconstruction method, and finally projecting the textures to the generated mesh when given the camera parameters in relation to the point cloud pose.
It can also perform registration between point clouds.

Screened poisson surface reconstruction, or PoissonRecon, is another stand-alone program as an alternative for surface fitting. \cite{kazhdan2013screened}

Cmpmvs is a multi-view reconstruction software for transforming a set of calibrated image data to a full textured mesh, used in a similar way as VisualSFM but using internally a different method based on graph cuts and weakly-supported surfaces.
\cite{jancosek2011multi}

Python Photogrammetry Toolbox is another pipeline combinator for full 3D reconstruction, popular in archaeological fields. It combines Bundler and PMVS and others. \cite{moulon2011python}

VisualSFM is probably the most common tool in the open source community.
It integrates into a few clicks the pipeline from images to 3D point cloud, using SiftGPU for features, PBA for camera estimation, and PMVS/CMVS for dense matching.
A common post step is to use Meshlab to filter outliers away from the data and to build a triangular textured mesh of it with the input points and normals.

\subsection{Sample reconstruction pipeline} % {{{
%\subsection{Full reconstruction} % {{

Both shape and texture are considered in this work. Only diffuse color (albedo) is of interest; more complex material properties are assumed to be captured in other means and not spatially varying.

Basic uv mapping. Project texture to computed mesh. Somehow use colors and optical flow everywhere...

Postprocessing: remodel the mesh (face), see what it would look like. Refine parameters to get a similar output as in the photos (normal map etc.), backproject. Use colors and highpass them; assume uniform lightning and locally uniform texture color (bradley). (Simply a rendering technique, that level of detail in 3D structure might not be needed).
