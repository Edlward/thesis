\mysection{Preface}
This thesis is the first step in an adventure that started from a need and interest for an end-to-end machinery for acquiring realistic 3D content for computer graphics research and content production in Aalto University.
The work was conducted in the Department of Media Technology at Aalto University, with help from the Automation Technology laboratory.
My personal field of study and greatest interest is Automation and Systems Technology, where a lot of similar applications of computer vision can be found.

I would like to thank my advisor Jaakko Lehtinen for his guidance regarding this work and for the glorious opportunity to work on such an interesting subject, and my supervisor Ville Kyrki for valuable and supportive feedback on this thesis.
Thanks too to my co-workers Markus Kettunen, Miika Aittala and Ari Silvennoinen for inspiring discussions in computer graphics during this work.

I would also like to express my gratitude to my family and friends for all the help and support.
Of them, special thanks to Arto Rusanen and Samuli Vuorinen for sharing their deep knowledge in imaging technology and lending me photography hardware.
