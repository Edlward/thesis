\subsection{Synchronization issues}

Synchronizing the image sources temporally is important for reconstruction algorithms to work correctly.
A synchronized system captures images from all cameras with a reasonably small time difference, so that subject movement does not introduce additional errors.

\subsubsection{Shutter delay} \label{sec:shutterdelaymeas}

Shutter delay consistency among cameras and shots blah blah.

An input pin of the MCU was connected to the hot shoe flash present in the camera body.
Assuming a negligible delay between the flash trigger signal and the actual photo exposure, the time between shutter button and signal from the flash connector is the shutter delay.
The camera was set up to all manual settings and manual focus.
Measurements matched consistently the 75 millisecond delay found in various sources, repeated shots varying less than a millisecond.
This suggests that even fast moving subjects can be captured properly.
The used test program for the Nucleo board can be found in the github repository by the name \emph{measure.cpp}.

A special flash synchronization method was considered using the hot shoe signals of all cameras.
When the camera orders the flash to fire, its shutter is fully open.
The same controller that drives the cameras would then monitor the hot shoe signals, and trigger the flashes when all the shutters have opened.
The method was not deployed because the cameras are synced well enough; with a shutter speed of 1/20 s, no dark frames were encountered during testing.

\subsubsection{Still capture}

Static subjects do not move or change shape.
However, still imagery of e.g. a human head needs at least semi-accurate syncing, because standing still enough is not possible for longer periods (seconds).
Even though the facial pose would not change, the wrong position of the head in a frame would introduce error.
Similarly, capturing e.g. a still image of a moving cloth needs proper synchronization.

For a completely static subject, the cameras can even be shot separately, each using its own integrated flash unit, to minimize shadows for each viewpoint.
When the light direction is almost the same as the camera's view direction, no shadows are possible.

Still capture using the wired remote trigger was analyzed with a moving object.
A standard 120 mm PC fan was rotated in the view of all cameras, with markings drawn around the fan and in the moving blades with a bright-colored pen.
The cameras were set to maximum aperture (f/1.8) and shortest possible shutter speed (1/4000 s) to minimize motion blur.
The fan speed had to be reduced by using 4.5 volts instead of the nominal 12 volts, resulting in about TODO revolutions per second, or TODO m/s on the far end of the fan blades.

Without any actual measurements done but only with careful manual observation, no significant sync mismatches were found by comparing the position of the rotating measurements in all nine different images.
Two such images are depicted in figure \ref{fig:fansynctest}.

\subsubsection{Video capture}

% intro

The EOS 700D does not support an external sync signal for video recording, but relies on an internal clock to sync the frames within a single video file.
It can be safely assumed that the clock speed has little variation, and thus, little drift and jitter occur in the videos.
Recording offset remains an issue;
processing time of each camera from the shutter button to start of first frame varies because of unknown reasons; even though a wireless remote control of the camera manufacturer would be used for starting several cameras at once, the offset was found to be sometimes almost as much as the duration of two frames.

% what was done

Visual and auo based tests were carried out to find variations in the recording offset.
Three cameras were triggered with several times a Canon RC-6 wireless remote control.
The remote sends a short infrared pulse to a sensor in the front of a camera when a key is pressed.
The camera was set in video mode and it was configured to use the remote release.
%The exposure time was set to minimum, 1/4000 s, to maximise the rolling shutter effect.
%In this mode, the sensor rows are exposed one by one in succession.
When all cameras were recording, a flash unit (Canon Speedlite 420EX) was aimed at the lenses and fired manually several times.

% what happens

A direct light pulse of a flash unit shows up as an over-exposed, completely white video frame, if the whole frame was exposing the image during the light pulse.
Sometimes only part of the frame would be exposed to the flash light as a rolling shutter effect.
Because the CMOS sensor is cleared and read line by line, the time of the flash can be deduced from the first bright line in the image.
The rows are zeroed from light in succession in the same way as a mechanical focal plane shutter moves and exposed until read.
Thus, the flash light's starting time in the video's internal clock is the frame's start time plus the duration that it takes for the rows before the overexposed one to show up:

\begin{align} \begin{split} \label{timingcalib}
t_{Cl} &= t_{Ci} + t_{Cf} \\
&= i_C * F + f_C / R * F \\
&= (i_C + f_C / r * c) * F
\end{split} \end{align}

where $C$ is a camera identifier, $t_{Cl}$ is camera-relative time for the light pulse, $t_{Ci}$ is the starting time for the frame where the light shows up, and $t_{Cf}$ is the time inside the particular frame.
The frame index $i$ marks the number of the frame in the video file, starts from 0, and there is $F$ = $1/\text{fps}$ time between the frames.
$f_C$ is the first exposed row, $R = r / c$ is the time for a single row to expose, $r$ is the vertical frame resolution and $c$ is a correction coefficient describing the relation of exposure time and frame duration ($0.5$ in this case, referring to 180 degree shutter).
Offset between two cameras $A$ and $B$ is then $t_{Al} - t_{Bl}$.
The timings are depicted in figure \ref{fig:flashtimeline} as a timeline with matching symbols.

For perfectly synchronized videos, the frames would be identical, and time difference calculated with eq. \ref{timingcalib} for each frame would be zero as $i_C$ and $f_C$ would be constants for all $C$.

{Video frames of three cameras started with the same remote, with the same frame index.

The start of the light pulse can be seen in the leftmost and rightmost frames.
In the middle one, the flash has been fired before the frame exposure started;
the frame before it is still without any overexposed light.
It is impossible to deduce the exact time in this case.

}


The method for measuring the synchronization error can be used to calibrate the differences, which is useful in artificial sync with optical flow or other methods, where frame timing is used.
A similar method using the recorded audio (as in fig. \ref{fig:flashaudio} is perhaps more familiar, where a distinct sound in the audio tracks recorded by the cameras would be used for calibration.
For a few cameras, the audio tracks are simple to align manually in an audio editing software, or automatically with cross-correlation to find the time lag.

Another method for triggering multiple video recordings is to use a ML-based wired remote trigger by pressing the half-shutter, or focus button when a record key has been configured in ML.
This method did not show any improvements in overcoming the offset.
% it may be even worse, as the additional code in ML induces more lag.

A typical measurement result is shown in figure \ref{fig:flashtiming}.
Audio recorded by the cameras' internal microphones at the same event is shown in figure \ref{fig:flashaudio}, and the order of flash pulses in the three frames can be verified from the order of the sound emitted by the flash.
Both methods show that the middle camera has started recording first, and subsequent time lags compared to it are approximately 21 and 31 milliseconds.

\subsection{Sample objects}

%The mask, human heads, legos, books

Some test subjects were scanned using the system with different light setups for analysis.
Nine cameras were set up in a 3 by 3 grid and two flash units were attached to two cameras, directed up and down to white styrofoam and fabric diffusers to soften the light.
Flash units were a Canon Speedlite 430EX and Yongnuo YN565EX II, set to normal front curtain sync.
The top-facing Canon flash has only automatic mode, which was sufficient; the Yongnuo was set to full power, facing downwards to a piece of fabric.

A black background matte was used to isolate unnecessary items in the background out;
chroma-keying would be an effective way to isolate the subject, but a non-textured background has the same effect.
The subject was surrounded by white styrofoam plates to even out the lighting.

The Bundler SfM system recommends to take photos at least every $\alpha = 15$ degrees around a subject.
With a distance $d$ of one metre from lens to the subject, this yields a baseline $b$ of approximately 26 cm by eq. \ref{eq:baselinedegrees}:

\begin{align} \begin{split} \label{eq:baselinedegrees}
	\sin \alpha/2 &= \frac{b/2}{d}\\
	b &= 2 d \sin \alpha/2
\end{split} \end{align}

The key parameters used for photographing the samples are listed in table \ref{tab:sampleshotparams}.

A human face contains enough distinct features for SfM to find the system structure, and methods for SfM, dense reconstruction and mesh texturing were tested.

Agisoft Photoscan and Agisoft StereoScan are commercial programs for scanning subjects from several pictures and a pair of stereo pictures, respectively. \cite{agisoft}
The programs are targeted for the end user and include tools for editing the resulting data, and need no external tools for outputting complete meshes.
Photoscan includes a free demo version, which does not include mesh exports; a couple of screenshots were taken for illustration.

Reconstructions in Photoscan add significant noise to skin surface.
Fig. \ref{fig:sample-arto-meshlab} depicts the results in different forms, with some of the source pictures shown in \ref{fig:sample-arto-photoscan-source}.
A typical face scan results in a very high-density point cloud of five million points, which the software reduces into a one million triangle mesh with textures.
Wrinkle detail tests can be seen in fig. \ref{fig:sample-arto-forehead}; a forehead has well detail so that the point cloud maps to the geometry well, resulting in also a wrinkled mesh.

Photoscan was found to be relatively robust to baseline length, reconstructing the scene geometry well with a baseline almost twice as much as by the 15 degree rule suggested in Bundler.
Because photoscan is targeted for artists, it is natural that it produces more production-quality meshes, doing more filtering in the way.

VisualSFM \cite{visualsfm} was tested with dense reconstruction done by PMVS \cite{pmvs} and meshing in Meshlab \cite{meshlab}.
Same datasets were tested as with Photoscan with similar results.
VisualSFM's feature matching seems not as robust as with Photoscan, sometimes resulting in separate models because of a too long baseline and displaying very few feature matches between pictures.
With a shorter baseline of approximately 30 cm, the SfM process was more successful.

PMVS \cite{pmvs} works by expanding patches in the reconstruction, resulting in a dense point cloud with oriented and colored points.
For mesh generation, the result was imported into \cite{Meshlab}.
The numerous outlier points were cleaned up manually, and a mesh was fitted using the Poisson surface reconstruction plugin.
Results of different steps of the pipeline can be seen in figure \ref{fig:sample-arto-meshlab}.

PMVS divides the source images iteratively to smaller sets, and begins at a halved size by default with one fourth of the pixel count of the original.
Using the original size was found to provide roughly twice the amount of points with four times longer processing time, but with no increased accuracy.
The documentation of this parameter also suggests that a halved size is used, because a large part of colors are interpolated in the original image because of the color filter array in the image sensor (sec. \ref{sec:sensors}).

\subsection{Feasibility}

\subsection{Facial surface motion capture} % {{{

\subsubsection{Deforming skin}

Surface capture of human skin is different from objects that consist of just connected rigid bodies: it stretches and shears in a highly non-predicatable way such that both its local geometry and texture changes, affected by the sub-surface properties of muscles etc.
Traditional methods for tracking rigid objects are thus not viable for high quality.
Joint motion capture has the rigid body assumption.

The deformations can be taken into account with e.g. furukawa etc.

Uncanny valley: humans are really good at identifying faces and correct facial movements; incorrect cases look really wrong.

\subsubsection{Simplifications/assumptions}

Facial expression space, 2d tracking, feature keypoints

Makeup

Facial expression space. Some techiques \cite{faceshift,something} use pre-recorded facial expressions to identify the subject's pose.
They suffer from not being able to accurately describe the temporal changes in finest details, but benefit from densely packed parameterization of facial expressions.
A separate mesh is stored as a three-dimensional template for each expression (such as happy or angry) and each frame is encoded, as a linear combination of these individual expressions.
%Such feature vectors describe well each possible face, and importantly, they eliminate the need for encoding the movement of each vertex, which can be unnecessarily heavy to compute or store.
%The results from this method can easily be mapped to other models than the face of the subject, as it is independent on the actual facial geometry and only uses weights for pre-modeled faces, making it interesting in computer animation.
%
Compare to Facial Action Coding System (FACS) (Hjortsj√∂ 1969), which parameterizes the face in a group of muscular actions. This is similar to grouping vertices in keyframe animation [?].

%Expression tracking / 2d capture

%Use colors and highpass them; assume uniform lighting and locally uniform texture color (bradley).

\subsection{Future work}

% TODO a restricted volume for the subject from the nature of the system, to filter outliers

%Although 

Constructing a 3D scanning rig was a large topic on its own.
The field of 3D reconstruction needs content to evolve, even more so for content-specific improvements.
The rig can be used for digitizing real-life objects and studying the process, helping to understand how different algorithms behave on different inputs.
Also, identifying defects in current state-of-the-art is easier when high-resolution test data can be scanned for testing new hypotheses.

The rig was found to be suitable for high-resolution capture of human faces, a target that is considered difficult because of the lack of well noticeable pattern.
High resolution photographs recover detail that can be used for feature matching and successful reconstruction.
By tweaking reconstruction parameters, applying soft makeup and using a more uniform lighting, the quality can be further improved;
especially the surface color is challenging to recover uniformly because of specular highlights, even though the reconstruction succeeds.
