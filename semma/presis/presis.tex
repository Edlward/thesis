\begin{frame}{non-static object capture using multi-view stereo video}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-static / dynamic: moving or morphing over time
	\item $\Rightarrow$ video, maybe not just a simple object
	\item object: some target of interest in front of a camera
	\item capture: encode the object's visual properties digitally \begin{itemize}
		\item geometry: 3d surface structure
		\item texture: (diffuse) color
		\end{itemize}
	\item multi-view stereo: recover 3D from photographs
	\item video: a sequence of frames
\end{itemize}
this presentation reviews the parts of the capture pipeline

\begin{frame}{Really multi-view}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Two camera case is still pretty dull
	\item Combine pairs, reconstruct individually, register in 3d
	\item Several on same baseline, match pairwise, fit least errors
	\item Use lots, arbitrarily positioned, magic algorithms
	\item Single camera traversing in a scene (SfM)
\end{itemize}
%\kuva{0.6}{ankka.jpg}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{From static to dynamic}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Static can be scanned with a single camera only
	\item Moving targets need static frames from many angles
	\item Images must be consistent within a frame
	\item Stream of static frames reconstructed, or more sophisticated tracking
\end{itemize}
%\kuva{0.6}{ankka.jpg}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Dynamic methods}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Brute force reconstruction of every video frame
	\item Register together, build a mesh while going
	\item Morph initial model based on frame deformations
	\item Track local pre-selected features in 2D
	\item Track features in 3D, deform mesh based on keypoints
	\item And more and more post-processing, assumptions on the object properties
\end{itemize}
%\kuva{0.6}{ankka.jpg}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Texture and topology}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reconstruction outputs local geometry properties
	\item Color per vertex, not textured, not meshed
	\item Reconstruct surface topology: fit data to surface, fill holes; use models
	\item Reproject camera views on ready mesh to recover texture maps
	\item Sometimes features tracked in 2D or 3D (still pre-recorded)
	\item Feature spaces and parameterizations in extreme cases

	\item 4D scan: multi-step pipeline from construction to shooting, reconstruction and post-processing
	\item Used method(s) largely application specific
	\item Lots of software, special applications coming, rising trend
	\item MVS just one scanning method
