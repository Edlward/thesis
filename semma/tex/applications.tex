\section{Applications}

The application domain for reconstructing three-dimensional fields is wide, and expands constantly with the ever increasing computing power. The popularity of handheld computers - smartphones - equipped with relatively good quality cameras is currently an attractive target for 3d scanning software, while the actual reconstruction works in the cloud

Facial surface motion capture (mocap) is currently a standard tool in the movie and video game entertainment industry among the more mature mocap for whole body movement to record performances for replaying them later.
Mocap records movements of a human body or another object that is to be recorded so that the movements can be replayed or analyzed.

Human performance capture is traditionally done on special easily distinguishable markers, typically small retroreflective dots, that are mapped to a model for playback. Playback then interpolates between the recorded positions. [CITE THESE] Advances in camera resolution make it possible to use only texture features without separate markers.

Something something large scale 3D scanning

The Matrix (1999) \cite{wachowski99matrix}, famous of the bullet-time scenes, used heavy optical flow processing to ``slow time down''; it is a good example on what is needed to capture data that changes over time in non-controllable and non-repeatable ways. The Matrix Reloaded \cite{wachowski03reloaded} used a technique called Universal Capture by Borshukov et al. \cite{borshukov05universal} to encode and simulate accurate facial movements in 3D.

Small objects have been scanned successfully with a turntable [CITE], and structure from motion techniques have recently been presented that impressively recover a structure from pictures taken all over an outdoor location with no a priori information about the camera configurations [CITE].
