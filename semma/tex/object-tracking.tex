\section{Tracking}

\subsubsection{Feature / surface tracking}

Pore-level matching, good resolution needed

Many cameras, zoom in to just a part of the target

Markers / markerless

Markers traditional

This work considers markerless capture important, because time-varying texture is important in facial capture (wrinkles from different facial expressions)

Special marker makeup / pre-recording of pore-level texture? Then "good enough" zillion markers and map and deform the mesh?

Corner detector (harris, sift, surf). Color usually not important. Brightness constancy. Repeated texture or no texture (uniform color = bad).

Matching to a priori model
