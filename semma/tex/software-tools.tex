\section{Software tools}

Now that the theoretical background has been described, this section reviews the current state of available tools on the reconstruction problem. There is a wide collection of libraries, open-source tools and commercial packages for both automatic reconstruction and generic mesh editing for post-processing the data.

\subsection{Libraries}

OpenCV.

Point Cloud Library.

CGAL.

\subsection{Free software}

(Matlab) camera calibration toolbox.

Bundler.

BigSFM.

SiftGPU.

PBA.

VisualSFM is a free but closed-source integration tool for A, B, C.

Meshlab.

PoissonRecon.

Cmpmvs.

VisualSFM [?] is probably the most common tool in the open source community.
It integrates into a few clicks the whole pipeline from images to 3D point cloud, using SiftGPU [?] for feature matching, PBA (multicore bundle adjustment) [?] for camera parameter estimation, and PMVS/CMVS [?] for dense matching.
A common post-process step is to use Meshlab [?], an interactive general-purpose mesh processing tool, to filter outliers away from the data and to build a triangular mesh of it. PMVS outputs oriented points, i.e. points with normals.
